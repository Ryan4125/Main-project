•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
	In this project I was given directions to develop code to transfer a file with 	city Fahrenheit temperatures and transfer them too Celsius. The problem it 	was solving was         converting it with a formula over to Celsius.
•	What did you do particularly well?
	I feel that I had good strong code in my project. I also believe I had very 	strong comments to support what the code was for.
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
	I feel I could focus on maybe making my code more efficient by trying to 	make it shorter.
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
	I feel the code that I had the hardest time with was trying to make my code 	connect to the file to read from, I had to do some research for that.
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
	The code I found transferable was using the file that had to be read from 	for the code to operate. I feel this really helped me understand it well.
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	By taking my time and understanding what I was doing and planning out on 	how I was going to develop the code to be more efficient.
